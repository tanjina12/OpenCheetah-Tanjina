/* Our own wrapper around a conditional variable to create a semaphore-like interface.
 * 
 * Semaphores are used by one thread (main in our case) to notify some other thread (the measurement
 * one) that something has happened. In our case, we use this to "interrupt" its waiting, wake up,
 * and notice it should stop measuring.
 * 
 * # How it works
 * This semaphore is based on _conditional variables_. These are essentially a notification
 * mechanism provided by the OS to allow a thread to sleep (i.e., be non-active) until another
 * thread sends it a notification to wake up.
 * 
 * We use three components to utilize the full idea:
 * 1. There is some memory area/variable, which is the _condition_ (in our case a boolean that
 *    denotes whether the measurement thread should stop measuring);
 * 2. There is a mutex lock protecting the memory area (locks are basic synchronization primitives.
 *    At any one time, only one thread can "hold" a lock - any others attempting have to wait for
 *    the first one to release it. This ensures that only the thread holding the lock can access
 *    the shared memory from #1); and
 * 3. There is the conditional variable itself that we use to notify the other thread an update has
 *    occurred.
 * 
 * The procedure is as follows:
 * - Any thread wishing to interact with the semaphore must acquire the mutex lock first to get
 *   access to the condition.
 * - Then, it depends on whether the thread is updating and sending a notification - or waiting for
 *   an update:
 *    - _Sending:_ The sending thread, while holding the lock, updates the condition. Then it
 *      notifies an update has been done.
 *    - _Receiving:_ The receiving thread will _block_ until a notification is received. Everytime
 *      a notification is received, it has to check the condition to see if the waiting is done. As
 *      such, it will _start_ with a lock on the condition; _release_ it while waiting; and then
 *      _re-lock_ it to check the condition. Then, either the wait function quits (and we have the
 *      lock still), or it continues waiting and releases the lock to allow the sending thread to
 *      update the variable.
 * 
 * It's confusing, but bear in mind that the lock and condition work together: at any one point the
 * condition is accessed, the lock must be held. The conditional variable is then a layer atop that.
